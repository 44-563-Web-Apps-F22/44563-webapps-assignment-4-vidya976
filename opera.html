    <h3>Princess Ida</h3>
    <h4>ACT-2
        SCENE :Gardens in Castle Adamant.  A river runs across the
        back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge.  Castle
        Adamant in the distance.</h4>
    <p>Girls:            
        Mighty maiden with a mission,
        Paragon of common sense,
        Running fount of erudition,
        Miracle of eloquence,</p>
    <p> Blanche:     
        Attention, ladies, while I read to you
        The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
        The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
    </p>
    <p>Princess:    
        Your theme's ambitious: pray you bear in mind
        Who highest soar fall farthest.  Fare you well,
        You and your pupils!  Maidens, follow me.
    </p>
    <p>Blanche:    
         I, madam, on Abstract Philosophy.
        There I propose considering, at length,
        Three points â€” The Is, the Might Be, and the Must.
        Whether the Is, from being actual fact,
        Is more important than the vague Might Be,
        Or the Might Be, from taking wider scope,
        Is for that reason greater than the Is:
        And lastly, how the Is and Might Be stand
        Compared with the inevitable Must!
    </p>
    <p>Chorus:           
        And thus to empyrean height
        Of ev'ry kind of lore,
        In search of wisdom's pure delight,
        Ambitiously we soar.
        In trying to achieve success
        No envy racks our heart,
        For all we know and all we guess
        We mutually impart!
        And all the knowledge we possess,
        We mutually impart,
        We mutually impart, impart.</p>
        <p>lorian:          
            In this college,
            Useful knowledge
                  Ev'rywhere one finds,
            And already,
            Growing steady,
                  We've enlarged our minds
        </p>
        <p>Hilarion:         
            Hush, scoffer; ere you sound your puny thunder,
            List to their aims, and bow your head in wonder!

            They intend to send a wire
                        To the moon</p>
        <p>Cyril:       To keep men off is only half their charge,
            And that the easier half. I much suspect
            The object of these walls is not so much
            To keep men off as keep the maidens in!
